# Unit-test
Unit testing is a process in programming that allows independent tests to be run for each function, method or class. 
They are needed to find bugs in the program at the very beginning of the code. 
Bugs detected early in the development process reduce the cost of fixing them.

The main purpose of the unit test is to check the input data against the expected performance. 
The unit test ensures that each part of the programme works consistently. 

Develop a calculator application with unit testing using Node.js and Mocha.

What the application should be able to:

Divide, multiply, add and subtract;
Display warnings if entered values are not numeric.
